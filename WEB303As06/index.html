                                    Dhoni is the first Indian wicket-keeper to score 4,000 Test runs.
                                    After hitting a six in the third Test against England in Southampton, Dhoni completed 50 sixes as a captain, an Indian record.
                                    Dhoni, with 294 dismissals in his career, ranks first in the all-time dismissals list by Indian wicket-keepers.
                                
                                    Dhoni is third captain (and the first non-Australian) overall to win 100 games.
                                    First player to pass 10,000 runs in ODI cricket with having a career average of over 50.
                                    Most not outs (84) in ODIs.
                                    Dhoni's 183* against Sri Lanka in 2005 is the highest score by a wicket-keeper.
                                    Dhoni and Bhuvneshwar Kumar were involved in a partnership of 100 not out against Sri Lanka, which is India's highest eighth wicket partnership in ODIs.[182]
                                    Dhoni holds the records of the most dismissals in an innings (6) and career (432) by an Indian wicket-keeper.
                                    Dhoni has the most stumpings (123) by any wicket-keeper in an ODI career, and is so far the only keeper to pass 100 stumpings.
